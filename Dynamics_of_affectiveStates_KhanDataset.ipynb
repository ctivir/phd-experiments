Despite the tutor's efforts to simplify the explanation, the student is still having trouble grasping the concept and is starting to show signs of frustration. The student's responses are becoming increasingly uncertain and hesitant, and they are starting to doubt their own understanding of the material. The tutor's gentle reminders and encouragement are not enough to alleviate the student's frustration, and it is likely that the student will feel this emotion next.\n",
