        "          Step 2: According to the problem, Debbie earned $1,600 more than Jim, so we can denote the amount Debbie earned as J + $1,600.\n",
        "          Step 3: We know that the total amount they earned together is $7,200. So, we can set up the following equation: J + (J + $1,600) = $7,200.\n",
        "          Step 4: Simplify the equation by combining like terms: 2J + $1,600 = $7,200.\n",
        "          Step 5: To solve for J, subtract $1,600 from both sides of the equation: 2J = $7,200 - $1,600 = $5,600.\n",
        "          Step 6: Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for J: J = $5,600 / 2 = $2,800.\n",
        "          Step 7: Substitute J = $2,800 back into the equation from Step 2 to find out how much Debbie earned: Debbie earned J + $1,600 = $2,800 + $1,600 = $4,400.\n",

        "          Step 2: We know that the total number of tickets is 261, so we can write the equation: S + A = 261.\n",
        "          Step 3: We also know that the total cost of the tickets is $2,780, with student tickets costing $10 and adult tickets costing $15. This gives us the equation: 10S + 15A = 2780.\n",
        "          Step 4: To solve these two equations, we can first multiply the first equation by 10 to make the coefficients of S the same in both equations: 10S + 10A = 2610.\n",
        "          Step 5: Now, subtract the new first equation from the second equation: 10S + 15A - (10S + 10A) = 2780 - 2610. This simplifies to 5A = 170.\n",
        "          Step 6: Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to solve for A: A = 170 / 5 = 34.\n",
